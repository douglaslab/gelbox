# TODO

- Get Y = bases mapping correct

## Per 12/12/17 discussion with Shawn
- Choose ml amount when inserting into a gel (pipet interface, like click-click (or click-hold) to draw up and click again to put down?)
√ Timeline should just be 0..1, always insert at time=0
√ New bases, mass, degrade model
√ Get 1kb ladder as test data in (yeah, but y=bases function isn't right)
