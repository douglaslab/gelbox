# TODO

- Get Y = bases mapping correct
- Degradation UI
	- Some kind of flow chart UI for seeing live outcomes? maybe shift drag or something, so it's not immediately apparent, but direct manpulation is?

## New Particle / Fragment Sim + UI

- Clean up deprecated UI, etc... from milestone 1

### Icons
- Fix aliased icons
- Fix concentration icon design (per Shawn)
- Fix fragmentation icon design (per Shawn)

### Particles
- Make into strings (allow both visualizations?)
- Fix aspect ratio; should maintain surface area
- "Bite" effect for degradation.

## Per 12/12/17 discussion with Shawn
- Choose ml amount when inserting into a gel (pipet interface, like click-click (or click-hold) to draw up and click again to put down?)
√ Timeline should just be 0..1, always insert at time=0
√ New bases, mass model
√ Add degrade to model
√ Get 1kb ladder as test data in (yeah, but y=bases function isn't right)
